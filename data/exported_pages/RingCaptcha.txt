RingCaptcha is a telephone-based CAPTCHA system that is primarily used to prevent automated software from being able to access websites. It does this by requiring the user to enter a code that is generated by an automated voice call. The code can only be heard by a human, so it is very difficult for automated software to bypass. This makes it an effective tool for preventing spam and other automated attacks.
