The Incident Response Plan Basics resource, found on the website of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), is a comprehensive guide for organizations to develop and implement effective incident response plans for handling cybersecurity incidents. This plan is based on the recognition that it is not a matter of if, but when, an organization will face a security incident. A well-designed incident response plan can help an organization minimize the impact of such an incident and quickly resume normal operations.
