The LexisNexis One Time Password tool allows users to generate a one-time password that can be used to log into their LexisNexis account. This password can be generated by entering a user's email address or by using the LexisNexis mobile app. The password is then emailed to the user and is valid for 24 hours. This tool can be used to help prevent unauthorized access to a user's account and to protect confidential information.
