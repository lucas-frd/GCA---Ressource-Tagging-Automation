Daito is a two-factor authentication app that offers a variety of features to keep your account safe. It generates a unique code every 30 seconds, so even if someone steals your password, they will not be able to access your account. You can also set up a fingerprint or Face ID for additional security. In addition, Daito offers a lost phone feature, which allows you to remotely disable access to your account if your phone is lost or stolen.
