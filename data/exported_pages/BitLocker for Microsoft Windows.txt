BitLocker is a server-based solution that helps to protect data on servers and clients running Microsoft Windows. It uses a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to encrypt data on a volume and to store cryptographic keys, digital signatures, and measurements that verify the integrity of a boot sequence. BitLocker can also encrypt data stored on external drives and USB drives.
