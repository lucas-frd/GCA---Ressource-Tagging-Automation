Bitcoin Talk Homepage is the official forum of the cryptocurrency community, primarily dedicated to discussing topics related to Bitcoin and other digital currencies. It was created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, and has since become the hub for information, discussion, and collaboration among crypto enthusiasts, developers, traders, and investors.

As its name suggests, Bitcoin Talk Homepage is based in Bitcointalk.org, which serves as its central online home.
