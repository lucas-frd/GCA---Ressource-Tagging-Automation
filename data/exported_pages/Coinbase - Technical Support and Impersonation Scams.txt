Coinbase is a popular and trusted platform for buying, selling, and storing various cryptocurrencies. However, like any other online service, it is also prone to scams and cyber threats. To protect its users, Coinbase has published a guide on their website to educate users about the common types of scams and impersonation schemes, particularly technical support scams.

Technical support scams are fraudulent activities designed to trick and deceive users into providing sensitive information or access to their accounts.
