Google's Security Key Enforcement tool requires that users have a physical security key in order to access their account. This is an extra layer of security that makes it much more difficult for hackers to gain access to a user's account. The tool is designed to work with any type of security key, including those that use a USB connection or those that are built into a user's smartphone.
