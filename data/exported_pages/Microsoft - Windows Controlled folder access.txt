Windows Controlled folder access helps protect your data from ransomware and other types of malware that try to encrypt or delete your files. When this feature is turned on, Only apps that Windows Defender Antivirus trusts are allowed to access your controlled folders. If an app that isn't on the list tries to make a change to a controlled folder, you'll get a warning and an option to allow or block the app.
