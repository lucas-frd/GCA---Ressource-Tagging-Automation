Cyber readiness checklists (CRCs) are a list of actions and best practices that organizations can use to assess and improve their preparedness for a cyber incident. The lists are organized into four categories: prevention, detection, response, and recovery. Each category contains a set of resources and activities that organizations can use to improve their capabilities in that area. 

The lists are not exhaustive, but they provide a good starting point for organizations to identify gaps in their current cyber readiness
