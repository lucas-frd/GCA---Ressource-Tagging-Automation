The organization 'CoinDesk' is a leading digital media platform that focuses on providing news, analysis, and information related to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. It was founded in 2013 and has since become a trusted source for individuals and businesses looking to stay updated on the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies.

One topic that CoinDesk covers is the concept of a 'rug pull'. This term refers to a type of scam that is prevalent in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space in which the 'project team' simply disappears with your coins, leaving you with little recourse to recover or achieve any return on your investment.
