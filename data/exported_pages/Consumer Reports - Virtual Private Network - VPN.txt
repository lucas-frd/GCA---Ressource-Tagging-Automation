VPN is a tool that helps improve online privacy by encrypting internet traffic and routing it through a secure server. This makes it more difficult for third parties to track and collect data about users. VPNs can also be used to bypass government censorship and access blocked websites. Consumer Reports provides an overview of how VPNs work, as well as tips for choosing a VPN service.
