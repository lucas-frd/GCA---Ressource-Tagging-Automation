Veridas Face Authentication is a biometric authentication tool that uses an individual's unique facial characteristics to verify their identity. The system captures an image of the user's face and compares it to a stored digital template to confirm their identity. Face authentication is a highly accurate way to verify someone's identity and can be used in a variety of security applications, such as access control, time and attendance tracking, and need-based customer service.
