The OWASP CSRFGuard is a tool that helps protect web applications from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. CSRF attacks exploit vulnerabilities in web applications that allow an attacker to inject malicious code that is executed by the victim's browser. This can allow the attacker to perform unauthorized actions, such as stealing data or taking over the victim's account.

CSRFGuard works by adding a randomly generated token to each web page that is generated by the server.
