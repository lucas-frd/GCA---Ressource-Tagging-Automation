The OWASP SAMM tool is designed to help developers and organizations create and maintain secure software development processes. It provides a framework for creating security policies and procedures, and provides guidance on how to implement these policies and procedures effectively. SAMM is divided into four main phases: Assess, Plan, Implement, and Monitor. Each phase contains a set of activities that should be completed in order to effectively secure software development.
