FaceTec is a 3D face authentication tool that uses facial recognition to verify a user's identity. The user's face is scanned in 3D and compared to a database of known faces. If the user's face matches a known face, the user is authenticated. FaceTec is used for security purposes, such as accessing restricted areas or logging into devices.
