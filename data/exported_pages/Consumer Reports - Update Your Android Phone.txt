Every Android phone is different, so Consumer Reports has created this tool to help you figure out how to update your specific Android phone. The tool will walk you through the process of checking for and installing updates for your phone's operating system, as well as for any apps that are installed on your phone. The tool also provides information on how to keep your phone secure, including how to set up a lock screen and how to enable two-factor authentication.
