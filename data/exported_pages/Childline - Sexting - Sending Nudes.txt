The Sexting & Sending Nudes tool on the Childline website is a collection of resources aimed at helping young people stay safe when sending or receiving sexual images and messages. The tool includes information on the potential risks of sexting, such as image-based sexual abuse, as well as advice on how to stay safe if engaging in this activity. There is also a section for parents and carers, which provides guidance on talking to children about sexting and staying safe online.
