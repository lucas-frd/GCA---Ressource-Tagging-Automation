SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication, remote shell services or command execution and file transfer between two networked computers. SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow it to authenticate the user, if necessary. It provides secure encrypted communications by using a combination of a private (secret) key and a public key. The private key is known only to the user, while the public key is freely distributed.
