The Scanning Project by Shadowserver collects internet-wide scanning data that is used by the security community to find and fix critical cybersecurity vulnerabilities before the bad guys can exploit them. The data collected by the Scanning Project helps security researchers identifyWhich systems are vulnerable to attack, where the vulnerabilities are located, and how they can be exploited. By providing this information to the security community, the Scanning Project helps make the internet a safer place for everyone.
