=Description=
<br>
sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.
