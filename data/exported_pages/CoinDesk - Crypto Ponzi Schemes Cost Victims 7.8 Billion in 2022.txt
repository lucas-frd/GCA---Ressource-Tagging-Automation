The organization 'Crypto Ponzi Schemes Cost Victims $7.8B in 2022' is an investigative report published by CoinDesk, a leading news and media platform focused on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The report is based on research conducted by TRM Labs, a blockchain intelligence and compliance company.

The main focus of the report is to shed light on the alarming rise of Ponzi schemes in the cryptocurrency industry. These schemes, also known as pyramid schemes, involve fraudulent investment programs where profits are recycled to pay yields or rewards to existing participants instead of investing the funds and drawing on real yield to do so.
