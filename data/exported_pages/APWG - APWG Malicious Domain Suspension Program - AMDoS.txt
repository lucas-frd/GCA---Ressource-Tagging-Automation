This resource is the APWG Malicious Domain Suspension Program, which provides a governed process for suspending maliciously registered domains securely, auditably, and with manageable scale. The program, known as AMDoS, allows Accredited Interveners to submit suspected malicious domain names for investigation by Sponsoring Registrars and Top-Level Domain Registries.

The APWG, in collaboration with governance bodies and operational directorates focused on brand integrity, has developed a suspension protocol that addresses technical and policy challenges associated with domain suspensions. The aim is to create a scalable and efficient system for identifying and suspending malicious domains.

The main features of the AMDoS program include a secure and auditable process for submitting suspected malicious domain names, ensuring that the suspension process is transparent and accountable. Accredited Interveners can provide information about potentially harmful domains, which are then investigated by Sponsoring Registrars and Top-Level Domain Registries.

By streamlining the suspension process, the program aims to protect internet users from malicious activities associated with these domains. The AMDoS program provides a framework for collaboration between various stakeholders, including domain registrars and registries, to effectively combat cyber threats.

Overall, the APWG Malicious Domain Suspension Program, or AMDoS, offers a governed and scalable approach to suspending maliciously registered domains. By facilitating collaboration and providing a secure process, the program aims to enhance brand integrity and protect internet users from potential harm.
