=Description=
<br>
Imprivata Confirm ID is a two-factor authentication solution that provides an extra layer of security for logging into systems and applications. It uses a hardware device, such as a USB token, to generate a one-time code that is used in addition to a regular password. This code is then verified by the Imprivata Confirm ID server before allowing access to the system.
