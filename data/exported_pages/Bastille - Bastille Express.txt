This tool, called Bastille Products, offers various options for continuous protection against security threats. The main features of this resource include the Bastille Enterprise and Bastille Express versions.

Bastille Enterprise is a comprehensive solution that can be deployed from a single floor to an entire enterprise. It involves the installation of sensors throughout the desired area, with a minimum of 5 sensors per area for optimal threat localization. These sensors are placed at a density similar to Wi-Fi access points. The primary function of Bastille Enterprise is to discover and localize device or threat sources within the secured area.

On the other hand, Bastille Express is a self-contained unit designed for real-time, 24/7 detection of cellular, Bluetooth, BLE, and Wi-Fi devices. It is specifically tailored for enterprise use and provides continuous monitoring and detection capabilities.

Both versions of Bastille Products offer continuous protection against security threats, with the Enterprise version providing a more comprehensive solution for larger deployments, while the Express version offers a self-contained unit for real-time detection.

Overall, Bastille Products aim to provide organizations with the means to proactively identify and mitigate security risks by detecting and localizing potential threats within their environments.
