A multi-signature wallet, also known as a multisig wallet, is a cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to store their coins in a wallet that is secured by multiple private keys. This means that in order to spend the coins in a multisig wallet, multiple users must sign off on the transaction. This makes it more difficult for a single user to hack the wallet and steal the coins, as they would need to have access to all of the private keys.
