The Google Authenticator is a mobile app that provides two-factor authentication for your Google account. When you enable two-factor authentication for your account, you'll need to enter a code that is generated by the app in addition to your password when you sign in. The code is valid for a limited time, and is reset periodically.

The app is available for iOS and Android devices, and you can also use it on a desktop or laptop if you install the Google Authenticator Chrome
