Orchestrated Authorization by Axiomatics is a system that enables the creation of fine-grained access control policies. It lets organizations specify exactly who has access to what resources, and under what conditions. This makes it possible to implement least privilege and need-to-know concepts, and fine-tune access control to the specific needs of an organization. The system is based on the XACML standard, and uses Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) to enforce policies
