Authentify is a two-factor authentication tool that adds an extra layer of security to online accounts. When signing in to an account, users will first enter their username and password as usual. However, they will then be prompted to enter a code that is sent to their mobile phone via text message. This code must be entered in order to gain access to the account.

If someone tries to log into an account protected by Authentify without the proper code, they will be denied access
