This tool, called Blacklight, is a real-time website privacy inspector designed to provide insights into user-tracking technologies employed by websites. By entering the address of any website, Blacklight scans it and reveals the specific user-tracking technologies in use, as well as the entities that are receiving your data. It aims to shed light on who may be monitoring your online activities while you work, watch videos, learn, explore, and shop on the internet.
  
  Blacklight primarily focuses on two aspects: ad trackers and third-party cookies. It tests whether the website in question is sending user data to advertising companies, indicating potential data sharing practices. Additionally, it examines the presence of third-party cookies, which are small files stored on your device by websites other than the one you are currently visiting. These cookies can be used to track your browsing behavior across multiple sites.
  
  The scanning process typically takes between 30 seconds and one minute to complete, providing users with quick and accessible information about the privacy practices of a given website. By using Blacklight, individuals can gain a better understanding of the data collection and tracking methods employed by websites, potentially leading to more informed decisions about their online activities.
