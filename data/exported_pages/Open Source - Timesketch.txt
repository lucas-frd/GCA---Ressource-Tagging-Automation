Timesketch is an open source tool for collaboration and aggregation of data for digital forensics. It helps analysts to work together on forensic investigations, sharing knowledge and expertise.

Timesketch allows analysts to upload data into sketches, which are like case files. The sketches are then stored in a central repository, where they can be searched and shared.

The sketches can be used to visualize data, such as timelines of events, and to generate reports.
