The European Early Warning and Information System (EEWIS) is a vital component of the European Union's Civil Protection Mechanism, which aims to improve the coordination and effectiveness of disaster response efforts across Europe. The system is managed by the European Commission's Directorate-General for Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations.

EEWIS serves as a platform for exchanging timely and accurate information on natural, technological, and humanitarian disasters among participating countries and partners. It provides a means for early warning and risk assessment.
