Azure ExpressRoute is a cloud service that provides a private connection between an organization’s on-premises infrastructure and Microsoft Azure data centers. ExpressRoute connections don’t go over the public Internet, which provides more reliability, faster speeds, and lower latencies than a typical Internet connection. 

ExpressRoute connections are established through a partnership with a connectivity provider, such as AT&T, British Telecom, Equinix, Level 3, Verizon, and XO
