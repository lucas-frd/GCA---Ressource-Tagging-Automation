Ghidra is a free and open-source software reverse engineering tool used to analyze compiled programs and create maps of their data. It can be used to find bugs, security vulnerabilities, and edit program code. The software was created by the National Security Agency (NSA) and is now maintained by the NSA's Research Directorate.

Ghidra decompiles executable programs to pseudocode, which makes it easier for security researchers to understand a program's purpose and find potential security flaws.
