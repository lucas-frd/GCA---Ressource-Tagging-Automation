SuperScan is a Windows-based port scanner created by the research team at the SANS Institute. It was designed to provide a quick and easy way to check for open ports on a given host, as well as identify the service or application running on that port. SuperScan can be run against a single host or multiple hosts simultaneously. It is also capable of performing a ping sweep to determine which hosts are online. SuperScan is a useful tool for network administrators and security professionals when troubleshooting
