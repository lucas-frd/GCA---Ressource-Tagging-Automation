ProtonMail is a secure email service provider based in Proton, Switzerland. It was founded in 2014 by a group of scientists from the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) who were concerned about online privacy and security.

The organization's mission is to provide an email service that protects the user's data and privacy by using end-to-end encryption. This means that only the sender and intended recipient can view the contents of the emails, making it virtually impossible for anyone else to intercept the content.
