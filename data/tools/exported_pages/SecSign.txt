SecSign is a secure login solution that offers two-factor authentication for logging into websites, applications, and services. It uses a combination of a user's username and password, and a one-time passcode generated by an app on the user's mobile device. SecSign's two-factor authentication is designed to be more secure than traditional username and password authentication, and can be used to protect both personal and corporate accounts.
