This resource, provided by the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), focuses on their eCrime Exchange (eCX) and its various features. The eCX is a data exchange platform specifically designed for cybercrime fighters. It offers a comprehensive data correspondence architecture and trust architecture to facilitate efficient collaboration among researchers, universities, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in combating cybercrime.

One of the main features of the eCX is its role as a clearinghouse for cybercrime machine event data. It serves as a centralized hub where relevant data can be shared, analyzed, and utilized by authorized members. The platform also incorporates a legal framework, data conventions, and access controls to ensure the secure and responsible handling of sensitive information.

Additionally, the APWG offers researcher grants to support academic institutions and researchers in their efforts to access and utilize the resources available within the eCX. These grants aim to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange among experts in the field of cybercrime.

For those interested in becoming members or accessing the eCrime Exchange data modules, the APWG provides contact information for membership inquiries. By reaching out to membership@apwg.org, individuals and organizations can request new membership or seek assistance with their existing membership.

Overall, the APWG's eCrime Exchange serves as a valuable resource for cybercrime fighters, offering a platform for data exchange, collaboration, and research grants to enhance the collective efforts in combating cyber threats.
