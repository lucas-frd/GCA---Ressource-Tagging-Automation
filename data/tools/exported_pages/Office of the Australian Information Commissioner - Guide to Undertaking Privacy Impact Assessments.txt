The Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Guide is a tool developed by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) to help organisations and agencies conduct PIAs. The Guide sets out a structured approach for conducting a PIA, including:

1. Describing the proposed project or initiative

2. Identifying the information handling practices that will be undertaken as part of the project or initiative

3. Assessing the privacy impacts of those information handling practices
