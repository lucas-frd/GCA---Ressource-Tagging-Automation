Hotspot Shield is a virtual private network (VPN) provider that offers its services through a Google Chrome extension. It was created by the company AnchorFree in 2005 and is headquartered in California, USA.

The purpose of Hotspot Shield is to provide users with a secure and private internet browsing experience. The extension encrypts all internet traffic to and from a user's device, making it nearly impossible for hackers to steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data.
