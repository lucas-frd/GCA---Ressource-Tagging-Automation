Front Line Defenders is an international human rights organization based in Dublin, Ireland. It was founded in 2001 with a mission to protect and support human rights defenders at risk around the world.

At the core of their work is the belief that everyone has the right to defend and promote human rights, and that those who do so should be able to do their work without fear of reprisals.
