=Description=
<br>
Brutespray is a tool that allows you to automatically brute force services like ssh, ftp, telnet, etc. 

It takes a list of targets and a list of user:pass combos (or a list of passwords) and goes through the list trying to login to each target with each combo. If it finds a valid combo, it prints out the target and the login details.
