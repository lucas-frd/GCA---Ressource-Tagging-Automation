XF Authenticator is a XenForo resource that allows you to add two-factor authentication to your XenForo installation. It adds an extra layer of security to your site by requiring a second factor (usually a code generated by an app on your phone) in addition to your password in order to log in. This makes it much harder for an attacker to gain access to your account, even if they have your password.
