Metta is a command line tool that helps developers to manage their Uber-Common development environment. It provides a simple way to create and maintain multiple development environments within a single project.

With Metta, developers can easily switch between different versions of Uber-Common libraries and tools, and can configure their environment to use specific versions of these libraries and tools. Metta also allows developers to share their development environment with other developers, and to collaborate on developing Uber-Common applications.
