The Magento 2 Mobile Login Extension is a tool that allows customers to log in to their Magento 2 account using their mobile phone. The extension will send a text message to the customer's mobile phone with a login link. The customer can then click on the link and be taken directly to their account page. The extension also includes a "remember me" feature so that customers can stay logged in on their mobile phone for future visits.
