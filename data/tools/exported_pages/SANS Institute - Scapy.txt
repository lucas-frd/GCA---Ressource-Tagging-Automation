=Description=
<br>
Created in 2003 by Philippe Biondi, Scapy is a powerful Python-based interactive packet manipulation program and library. It can be used to forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send them on the wire, capture them, and much more. Scapy can be used interactively from a command line or in scripts, and it is also faster and more flexible than many other packet crafting tools available.
