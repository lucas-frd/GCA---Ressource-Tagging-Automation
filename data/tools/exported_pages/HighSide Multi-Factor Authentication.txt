HighSide Multi-Factor Authentication is a security tool that adds an extra layer of protection to your online accounts. It works by requiring you to confirm your identity using two factor authentication, which can include a fingerprint scan, iris scan, or a one-time code sent to your mobile device. This makes it much more difficult for hackers to gain access to your accounts, and helps to keep your confidential information safe.
