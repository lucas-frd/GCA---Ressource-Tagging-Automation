Scam websites are those that try to trick you into giving them your personal information or money. They may look like legitimate websites, but they often have fake or misleading information. Sometimes they even copy the design of a legitimate website.

You can tell if a website is a scam if it:

-Asks for personal information like your credit card number or Social Security number

-Has misspellings or bad grammar

-Does not have a privacy policy
