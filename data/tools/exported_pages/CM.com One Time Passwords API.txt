The CM.com One Time Passwords API allows developers to add an additional layer of security to their applications by generating one-time passwords (OTPs). This can be useful for situations where extra security is needed, such as when logging into a account from a new device or when making sensitive transactions.

The API uses the HMAC-based One-time Password algorithm (HOTP) to generate the OTPs, which are then sent to the user via SMS or email
