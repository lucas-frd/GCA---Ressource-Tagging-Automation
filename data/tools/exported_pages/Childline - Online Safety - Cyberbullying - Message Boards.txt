The tool Online Safety & Cyberbullying - Message Boards is a space where young people can come to chat about online safety and cyberbullying. The boards are moderated by Childline counsellors, who are there to offer support and guidance. The boards are a safe place to talk about any concerns or experiences, and to get advice from others who may have been in similar situations.
