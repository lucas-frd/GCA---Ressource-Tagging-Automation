Check Point is a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions, with a strong emphasis on intrusion prevention systems (IPS). Their IPS technology is designed to protect businesses and organizations from cyber attacks by identifying and blocking malicious activity in real-time.

Check Point's IPS works by constantly monitoring network traffic for suspicious behavior, such as unusual access requests or abnormal data transfers. It uses a combination of signature-based detection, where known threats are identified and blocked, and behavioral analysis, where anomalous activity is flagged for further investigation.
