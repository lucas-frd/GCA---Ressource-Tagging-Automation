CryptoPass is a password management tool that uses two-factor authentication to help protect your online accounts. It generates a unique code that you need to enter, along with your username and password, to log in to your account. The code is generated by an app on your smartphone or tablet, and is different each time you login. This makes it more difficult for someone to hack into your account, even if they manage to steal your username and password.
