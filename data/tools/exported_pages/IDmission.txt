IDmission is an online tool that helps organizations verify the identity of their employees, contractors, and customers. The tool uses a variety of data points to verify someone's identity, including social media profiles, government IDs, and other online records. Once someone's identity is verified, the tool provides a report that includes the person's name, address, and other information that can be used to verify their identity.
