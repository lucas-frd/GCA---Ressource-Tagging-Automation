SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) is a security protocol that provides a secure connection between a website and its users. This protocol ensures that any sensitive information shared between the two parties is encrypted, making it difficult for hackers to intercept and access the data. Cloudflare, a leading SaaS (Software as a Service) provider, takes SSL/TLS very seriously by implementing a robust and comprehensive security system to protect its customers from potential cyber threats.
