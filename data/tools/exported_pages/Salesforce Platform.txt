It includes an Identity Connector that allows customers to connect their identity providers (such as Active Directory or LDAP) to Salesforce, and a federated login that allows customers to use their identity provider credentials to access Salesforce. Additionally, Salesforce Platform provides a self-service password management feature that allows customers to reset their own passwords.
