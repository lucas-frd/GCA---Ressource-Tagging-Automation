The CCTX emphasizes the importance of shared information in strengthening defenses against cyber attacks. By promoting the widespread sharing of knowledge and resources, the organization aims to foster collective defense against cyber threats.

One of the key features of the CCTX is its Collaboration Centre, which provides a platform for cyber security professionals to engage in discussions and exchange ideas on how to effectively defend against the latest threats.
